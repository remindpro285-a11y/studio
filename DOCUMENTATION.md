## 4. Getting Started: Prerequisites

Before using the application, you must have the following:

1.  **A Supabase Project**: A free Supabase account and project are required to store application settings.
2.  **A WhatsApp Business Account (WABA)**: You need an approved WABA connected to a phone number.
3.  **Approved Message Templates**: You must have pre-approved message templates for both fee reminders and grade reports in your WhatsApp Business Manager. The application sends messages using these templates.
    *   **Fees Template Example**: `Dear Parent, the {{1}} for your child, {{2}}, of â‚¹{{3}} is due on {{4}}. Thank you.`
    *   **Grades Template Example**: `Dear Parent, the results for the {{1}} for your child, {{2}}, are as follows: {{3}}.`

## 6. User Guide: Sending Notifications Step-by-Step

The application guides you through a simple 4-step process.

### Step 0: Unlock Dashboard
*   When you first visit the application, it will be locked.
*   Enter the password configured for the application to unlock the dashboard and begin the process.

### Step 1: Upload Data
*   **Select Mode**: At the top of the next screen, choose whether you are sending **Fee Notifications** or **Grade Reports**. This choice determines the required data fields.
*   **Choose File**: Click the "Choose File" button and select the Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) or CSV (`.csv`) file containing the student data.
*   The application will parse the file and, upon success, automatically move you to the next step.

### Step 2: Map Columns
*   This is a critical step where you tell the application which column in your spreadsheet corresponds to which piece of required information.
*   The application will attempt to automatically map the columns based on common naming conventions (e.g., a column named "Student Name" will be mapped to the `studentName` field).
*   Use the dropdown menus to correct or complete the mappings. **All fields marked with an asterisk (`*`) are required.**
*   For **Grade Reports**, any columns that are *not* mapped will be automatically concatenated and included as the list of grades in the final message.
*   Once all required fields are mapped, the "Confirm Mappings & Preview" button will become enabled. Click it to proceed.

### Step 3: Preview & Send
*   **Final Configuration**: Fill in any remaining template details, such as the "Fee Name" and "Due Date" for fees, or the "Exam Name" for grades.
*   **Live Message Preview**: On the left, you will see a live preview of what the WhatsApp message will look like for the first student in your data file. This updates in real-time as you type.
*   **Data Preview**: On the right, you can review the parsed data in a table to ensure everything looks correct. Use the pagination controls to look through the records.
*   **Send**: When you are satisfied, click the large "Send Notifications" button at the bottom.

### Step 4: Status
*   You will be taken to a final status screen.
*   A progress bar will show the status of the sending process.
*   Below the progress bar, a table will populate in real-time, showing the status (`success` or `failed`) for each student. If a message failed to send, a reason will be provided.
*   Once the process is complete, you can click **"Send Another Batch"** to return to the start.

## 7. Security Architecture

The platform was designed with a security-first approach.

*   **No Client-Side Secrets**: All sensitive keys (Supabase key, WhatsApp Access Token) are used exclusively on the server side and are never exposed to the user's browser.
*   **Server Actions**: All mutations and sensitive operations (password verification, API calls, settings updates) are handled via Next.js Server Actions, which run securely on the server.
*   **Access Control**: Both the data upload functionality and the settings page are protected by a password, preventing unauthorized use.
*   **Database Security**: Row-Level Security (RLS) can be enabled in Supabase for an additional layer of data protection, although the current architecture is already secure by design as it only stores configuration data.

---

## 8. Data File Requirements

*   The file must be in a standard Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`) or CSV (`.csv`) format.
*   The first row of the sheet must be the **header row** (e.g., "Student Name", "Phone Number").
*   Ensure phone numbers include the country code but no `+` symbol or special characters (e.g., `919876543210`).
*   For **Fee Reminders**, you must have columns that can be mapped to: Student Name, Class, Phone Number, and Fee Amount.
*   For **Grade Reports**, you must have columns for: Student Name, Class, and Phone Number. All other columns will be treated as subjects and their corresponding marks.

## 9. Troubleshooting

*   **Error: "Unexpected token '<', "<html>..." is not valid JSON"**: This almost always means the WhatsApp API endpoint in your settings is incorrect or your backend server is down, causing the platform to receive an HTML error page instead of a JSON response. **Solution**: Verify the endpoint URL in settings and ensure your backend is running.
*   **Error: "API settings not found..."**: This means the settings have not been saved correctly in the database. **Solution**: Go to the `/settings` page, fill in all the details, and click "Save Settings". Use the test buttons to confirm the connection.
*   **Error: "Template not found"**: The template name you entered in the settings does not match the name of an approved template in your WABA. **Solution**: Double-check the template name for typos and ensure it has been approved by Meta.
*   **Dashboard is Locked**: If you forget the password, you will need to manually access the Supabase database, navigate to the `settings` table, and either clear or update the `lock_password` field for the entry with `id=1`.
